#### Chocolate Caramel Tart
##### Ingredients
- *Crust*
    - 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
    - 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    - 1/4 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder
    - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, diced
    - 1 large egg yolk
    - 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- *Caramel Filling*
    - 2 cups granulated sugar
    - 1/2 cup water
    - 1/4 cup light corn syrup
    - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons
    - 1/2 cup heavy cream
    - 2 tablespoons creme fraiche/sour cream
    - Pinch or two flaky sea salt
- *Ganache Topping*
    - 1/2 cup heavy cream
    - 3 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
    - Pinch or two flaky sea salt
    
##### Special Kitchen Tools
- Food processor
- Tart pan
- Oven

##### Let's get baking
1. Pulse sugar, flour, and cocoa powder in food processor until mixed
2. Add butter, yolk, and vanilla and mix until clumps form
3. Press crust into bottom and sides of tart pan
4. Transfer pan to freezer and freeze until solid
5. Prick frozen crust with a fork
6. Coat piece of foil with nonstick spray and press tightly against frozen crust
7. Bake tart with foil for 15 minutes
8. Let cook on rack
9. In large saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup, and turn to medium-high
10. Remove from heat and whisk in butter
11. Pour into prepared crust
12. Let caramel set in fridge until cool and firm
13. Place chopped chocolate in heatproof bowl and bring ceram to summer
14. Pour chocolate and let sit undisturbed for 2 minutes
15. Whisk until smooth and spread over cooled caramel layer
16. Let sit in fridge until firm to touch
17. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt before serving

Great for any time of the year! Can alternatively serve with fresh fruit on top!

## Euclidean Distance

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$). In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = ($p_{1}, p_{2},...,p_{n}$) and **q** = ($q_{1}, q_{2},...,q_{n}$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).

$$d(\textbf{p,q}) = d(\textbf{q,p}) = \sqrt{(q_{1} - p_{1})^{2} + (q_{2} - p_{2})^{2} + \cdot \cdot \cdot + (q_{n} - p_{n})^2} \\ =\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_{i} - p_{i})^{2}}.$$

The position of a point in Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.
$$||\textbf{p}|| = \sqrt{p^{2}_{1} + p^{2}_{2} + \cdot \cdot \cdot + p^{2}_{n} = \sqrt{\textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{p}}},$$
where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
